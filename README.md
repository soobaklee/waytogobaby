# Way To Go Baby

## Introduction
______________________________

I have often wondered how parents have the time to research baby bottles, bottle warmers (or even the need for bottle warmers!), formula, swaddles, toys, pacifiers, etc. When your baby is going to come regardless of your preparedness, Way To Go Baby holds all of the necessities the majority of babies may need. Parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, friends, nannies, and even your next door neighbor can read reviews from other child caretakers and receive advice and encouragement on all of the new adventures as an expecting parent.

View the community page to checkout items other families no longer need or are willing to share. The community page also provides access to a discussion board to pose concerns and help others through theirs.

## Ice Box

For all the parents looking for new friends, Way To Go Baby also is the way to find a new friend or a group of baby pals to commune with and establish life-long relationships for yourself or for babies. This is an Ice Box feature to develop, but it should be ready in the next month.
